- **Modify element attributes** and properties
- **Create and append new elements** dynamically
- **Understand CSS class manipulation** for styling changes

### Week 6: Events and Interaction

- **Handle user events** (clicks, form submissions, keyboard input)
- **Understand event objects** and event propagation
- **Implement form validation** and user feedback
- **Create interactive user interfaces** with real-time updates
- **Manage event listeners** effectively
- **Build responsive, dynamic web applications**

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

### DOM Fundamentals

- Document Object Model structure
- Node types and relationships
- Browser rendering process
- DOM vs HTML differences

### Element Selection

- `document.getElementById()`
- `document.querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()`
- `getElementsByClassName()` and `getElementsByTagName()`
- CSS selector syntax in JavaScript

### Content Manipulation

- `innerHTML` vs `textContent` vs `innerText`
- Creating elements with `createElement()`
- Appending and removing elements
- Cloning and moving elements

### Attribute and Style Management

- Getting and setting attributes
- Working with data attributes
- Inline styles vs CSS classes
- `classList` methods (add, remove, toggle, contains)

### Event Handling

- Event listeners vs event handlers
- Event object properties and methods
- Event bubbling and capturing
- Preventing default behavior
- Event delegation patterns

### Form Interaction

- Form element selection and values
- Input validation techniques
- Form submission handling
- Real-time input feedback

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Completion of JavaScript Fundamentals (Week 1-4)
- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS
- Familiarity with functions, arrays, and objects

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `02-dom-manipulation` directory
2. Start with `week5-dom-basics/01-dom-introduction.md`
3. Work through exercises after each concept
4. Build the practice projects to reinforce learning
5. Complete the capstone project to demonstrate mastery

## 📖 How to Use This Module

### 1. **Theory First**

- Read the markdown files in order
- Understand concepts before moving to exercises
- Use browser DevTools to experiment with examples

### 2. **Practice Exercises**

- Complete exercises in the `exercises/` folders
- Don't skip the hands-on practice
- Experiment with variations of each exercise

### 3. **Build Projects**

- Start with simpler projects and progress to complex ones
- Apply multiple concepts in each project
- Focus on clean, readable code

### 4. **Test and Debug**

- Use browser DevTools extensively
- Practice debugging techniques
- Test in multiple browsers

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources

### Browser Developer Tools

- **Elements Panel**: Inspect and modify DOM in real-time
- **Console**: Test JavaScript commands and debug
- **Sources**: Debug JavaScript with breakpoints
- **Network**: Monitor resource loading

### Recommended Extensions

- **Live Server** for VS Code - Auto-refresh during development
- **HTML CSS Support** - Better autocomplete
- **Bracket Pair Colorizer** - Easier code reading

### Reference Materials

- [MDN DOM Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
- [MDN Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) - Browser compatibility

## 🎯 Practice Approach

### Daily Practice (30-60 minutes)

1. **Read theory** (15-20 minutes)
2. **Complete exercises** (20-30 minutes)
3. **Experiment** with browser DevTools (10-15 minutes)

### Weekly Goals

- **Week 5**: Master DOM selection and manipulation
- **Week 6**: Build interactive, event-driven applications

### Success Metrics

- [ ] Can select any element using multiple methods
- [ ] Can modify content, attributes, and styles dynamically
- [ ] Can handle various types of user events
- [ ] Can create responsive, interactive web pages
- [ ] Can debug DOM-related issues effectively

## 🚧 Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Element Not Found

```javascript
// Problem: null reference error
const element = document.getElementById("nonexistent");
element.textContent = "Hello"; // Error!

// Solution: Always check if element exists
const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
if (element) {
  element.textContent = "Hello";
}
```

### Challenge 2: Event Listeners on Dynamic Elements

```javascript
// Problem: Event listener not working on dynamically created elements
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", handler); // Fails

// Solution: Use event delegation or add listeners after creation
document.body.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  if (e.target.id === "button") {
    handler(e);
  }
});
```

### Challenge 3: Timing Issues with DOM Loading

```javascript
// Problem: Script runs before DOM is ready
const element = document.getElementById("myElement"); // null

// Solution: Wait for DOM to load
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
  // Now element exists
});
```
