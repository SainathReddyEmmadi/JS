## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

### Week 11: Object Fundamentals and Constructor Functions

- **Master Object Fundamentals**: Properties, methods, and object manipulation
- **Understand Constructor Functions**: Creating objects with constructors and the `new` keyword
- **Explore Prototypes**: Prototype chain, inheritance, and prototype methods
- **Handle Object Context**: Understanding `this` keyword in different contexts
- **Implement Object Patterns**: Factory functions, module patterns, and object composition

### Week 12: ES6 Classes and Advanced OOP

- **Master ES6 Classes**: Class syntax, constructors, and methods
- **Implement Inheritance**: `extends` keyword and super calls
- **Use Static Methods**: Class-level methods and properties
- **Apply Encapsulation**: Private fields and methods
- **Understand Polymorphism**: Method overriding and dynamic dispatch
- **Create Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns

## 🌟 Key Concepts Covered

### Object Fundamentals

- **Object Creation**: Literals, constructors, and `Object.create()`
- **Property Descriptors**: Configurable, enumerable, writable properties
- **Object Methods**: Getters, setters, and method definitions
- **Object Iteration**: `for...in`, `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`
- **Object Composition**: Combining objects and mixins

### Constructor Functions and Prototypes

- **Constructor Functions**: Creating objects with shared behavior
- **Prototype Chain**: Understanding JavaScript's inheritance model
- **Prototype Methods**: Adding methods to prototype
- **Prototype Pollution**: Security considerations and prevention
- **Built-in Prototypes**: Extending native objects (when appropriate)

### ES6 Classes

- **Class Declarations**: Modern syntax for creating classes
- **Constructor Method**: Initializing class instances
- **Instance Methods**: Methods available on class instances
- **Static Methods**: Class-level methods and properties
- **Private Fields**: Encapsulation with private properties
- **Class Expressions**: Creating classes as expressions

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

- **Classical Inheritance**: `extends` keyword and inheritance hierarchy
- **Method Overriding**: Customizing inherited methods
- **Abstract Classes**: Base classes that shouldn't be instantiated
- **Interfaces**: Defining contracts for classes
- **Composition vs Inheritance**: When to use each approach

### Encapsulation and Abstraction

- **Data Hiding**: Private properties and methods
- **Access Control**: Public, private, and protected members
- **Information Hiding**: Exposing only necessary interfaces
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details
- **Immutability**: Creating immutable objects

### Design Patterns

- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Command
- **MVC Pattern**: Model-View-Controller architecture
- **Module Pattern**: Organizing code into modules
