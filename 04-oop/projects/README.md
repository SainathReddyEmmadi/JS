## 📝 Creating Your Own Projects

When creating new OOP projects, consider:

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each class should have one job
- **Proper Encapsulation** - Hide internal implementation details
- **Clear Inheritance Hierarchies** - Don't make them too deep
- **Composition over Inheritance** - When it makes sense
- **Design Patterns** - Use them appropriately, not everywhere
