# Functional Programming Module

Welcome to the Functional Programming module! This comprehensive guide will teach you how to write elegant, predictable, and maintainable JavaScript code using functional programming principles.

## 🎯 Module Overview

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In JavaScript, FP concepts help you write cleaner, more predictable code that's easier to test and debug.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- ✅ Understand core functional programming concepts
- ✅ Write and use higher-order functions effectively
- ✅ Master closures and their practical applications
- ✅ Create pure functions and avoid side effects
- ✅ Work with immutable data structures
- ✅ Use functional array methods fluently
- ✅ Apply currying and partial application
- ✅ Compose functions for complex operations
- ✅ Implement common functional patterns
- ✅ Build a complete functional programming project
