## Exercise Guidelines

### Difficulty Levels

- ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner**: Basic concept application
- ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate**: Combining multiple concepts
- ðŸ”´ **Advanced**: Complex real-world scenarios

### How to Use These Exercises

1. **Read the Theory First**: Complete the corresponding theory file before attempting exercises
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with beginner exercises and progress gradually
3. **Test Your Solutions**: Each exercise includes test cases to verify correctness
4. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding the underlying concepts
5. **Experiment**: Try different approaches to solve the same problem

### Running the Exercises

```bash
# Navigate to the exercises directory
cd exercises

# Run a specific exercise
node 01-function-types.js

# Run all exercises (if you have a test runner setup)
npm test
```

### Common Patterns You'll Practice

1. **Function Composition**: Building complex operations from simple functions
2. **Data Transformation**: Converting data using functional techniques
3. **Error Handling**: Managing errors functionally without exceptions
4. **State Management**: Handling state immutably
5. **Async Operations**: Functional approaches to asynchronous code

### Tips for Success

- **Think in Terms of Transformations**: View problems as data transformations
- **Start with Pure Functions**: Always prefer pure functions when possible
- **Use Immutable Data**: Avoid mutating existing data structures
- **Compose Small Functions**: Build complexity through composition
- **Test Incrementally**: Test each function in isolation

### Additional Resources

- **MDN Array Methods**: [Array.prototype methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
- **Functional Programming Guide**: [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/)
- **Practice Platform**: [Codewars Functional Programming](https://www.codewars.com/)

### Getting Help

If you're stuck on an exercise:

1. Review the theory material again
2. Break the problem into smaller parts
3. Start with the simplest possible solution
4. Look at the test cases for hints about expected behavior
5. Don't hesitate to research functional programming concepts online
