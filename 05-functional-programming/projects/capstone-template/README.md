# Functional Task Management System

## Getting Started

This is the starter template for the Functional Programming capstone project. Follow the implementation phases to build a complete task management system using functional programming principles.

## Project Setup

1. Clone or download this template
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development: `npm start`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates functional programming concepts through:

- **Pure Functions**: All business logic implemented without side effects
- **Immutability**: State management without mutation
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Data processing pipelines
- **Function Composition**: Building complex operations from simple functions
- **Functional Patterns**: Maybe, Either, and validation patterns

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Implement FP utility functions (utils/)
- [ ] Create task entity operations (core/task.js)
- [ ] Set up validation system (core/validation.js)
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions

### Phase 2: Data Processing

- [ ] Build filtering pipelines (data/filters.js)
- [ ] Implement search functionality (data/processing.js)
- [ ] Create aggregation functions (data/aggregation.js)
- [ ] Add sorting and grouping operations

### Phase 3: State Management

- [ ] Implement immutable state updates (core/state.js)
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Create event sourcing system (core/events.js)
- [ ] Implement state persistence

### Phase 4: User Interface

- [ ] Build functional UI components (ui/components.js)
- [ ] Implement event handling (ui/events.js)
- [ ] Create rendering pipeline (ui/rendering.js)
- [ ] Add user interactions

## Key Files

- `src/app.js` - Main application entry point
- `src/core/` - Core business logic and entities
- `src/utils/` - Functional programming utilities
- `src/data/` - Data processing and transformation
- `src/ui/` - User interface components and rendering

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify your implementations:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are organized by module:

- `tests/core/` - Core functionality tests
- `tests/utils/` - Utility function tests
- `tests/data/` - Data processing tests

## Documentation

As you implement features, update:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture decisions
- `docs/API.md` - Function API documentation
- `docs/PATTERNS.md` - Functional patterns used

## Resources

- Review Week 13-14 theory materials
- Refer to `../resources/README.md` for additional resources
- Check `../capstone-project.md` for detailed requirements

## Assessment

Your project will be evaluated on:

- Correct application of FP concepts (50%)
- Code quality and organization (20%)
- Functionality and features (20%)
- Documentation and testing (10%)

Good luck with your functional programming capstone!
