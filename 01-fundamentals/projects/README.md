## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Running the Projects

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently:

1. Navigate to any project directory:

   ```bash
   cd calculator
   # or
   cd grade-calculator
   # or
   cd todo-basic
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:

   - Double-click the `index.html` file, or
   - Use a local server (recommended):

     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000

     # Using Node.js (http-server)
     npx http-server

     # Using VS Code Live Server extension
     # Right-click index.html -> "Open with Live Server"
     ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

## üéØ Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure for easy learning:

```
project-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Modern CSS styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # JavaScript functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project-specific documentation
```

### Code Organization Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JavaScript for behavior
2. **Modular Design**: Functions and classes are organized logically
