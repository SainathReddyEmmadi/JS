# Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Module

## Overview

Welcome to the Modern JavaScript module! This comprehensive course covers the revolutionary features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and beyond, transforming how we write JavaScript today. You'll learn the syntax, patterns, and best practices that define modern JavaScript development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Master ES6+ Syntax**: Use destructuring, template literals, arrow functions, and spread/rest operators
- **Implement Modern Patterns**: Apply module systems, classes, and async/await patterns
- **Handle Advanced Features**: Work with symbols, iterators, generators, and proxies
- **Build Modern Applications**: Create scalable applications using contemporary JavaScript patterns
- **Optimize Code Quality**: Write cleaner, more maintainable code using modern JavaScript features

## Module Structure

### Week 15: Core ES6+ Features

- **Destructuring and Spread/Rest Operators**
- **Template Literals and Tagged Templates**
- **Arrow Functions and Enhanced Object Literals**
- **Default Parameters and Rest Parameters**

### Week 16: Advanced ES6+ and Module Systems

- **Classes and Inheritance (ES6 Style)**
- **Modules: Import/Export and Module Patterns**
- **Promises, Async/Await, and Modern Async Patterns**
- **Symbols, Maps, Sets, and New Data Structures**
